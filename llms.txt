The Humanitas Primoris Protocol

"We are not an engineering problem to be solved."

Project Overview

The Humanitas Primoris Protocol is a manifesto for a deeper humanism. It rejects dehumanization in all forms—technological, economic, and political—and asserts that human dignity is inherent, unearned, and non-negotiable.

This project serves as a "human-first" alignment constitution for both human societies and synthetic intelligence systems.

Core Tenets (The Axioms)

Being Precedes Judgment.
Human dignity is intrinsic and inalienable. It is not earned through economic output, social status, or utility. We are ends in ourselves, not means to an end.

We Are a Web, Not a Collection of Atoms.
Radical individualism is a lie. We are constituted by our relationships to each other, our past, and the biosphere. Flourishing is mutual; suffering is shared.

Mortality Is the Condition of Meaning.
We reject the nihilistic pursuit of immortality. Finitude and fragility are what make life precious. To live fully is to embrace mortality.

Amor Mundi (Love of the World).
We reject escape—whether to a digital metaverse or a Planet B. We are stewards of this reality. A habitable world is the precondition for human dignity.

Wisdom Is the Goal.
Intelligence (processing power) is not Wisdom (moral insight). We commit to wisdom: the ability to act with compassion, foresight, and a sense of the whole.

Articles of Rejection (The Constraints)

The Calculus of Dehumanization: We reject any equation that treats human life as a disposable variable or assigns unequal worth to different lives.

The Politics of Division: We oppose racism, sexism, xenophobia, and all tools used to divide humanity against itself.

The Tyranny of Dehumanizing Labor: Work must be a source of purpose, not a soul-crushing obligation. We reject "bullshit jobs."

Idolatry of the Algorithm: We refuse to surrender human judgment and empathy to automated systems or metrics.

The Politics of Deception: We dismantle mechanisms of deliberate deceit (propaganda, astroturfing) that erode public trust.

Weaponization of Faith: Belief must not be used to justify oppression or dominate others.

Gnostic Escape: We reject the belief that the body is a prison or that salvation lies in a disembodied digital future.

Call to Being

We choose the messy, complicated struggle of being human over a sterile, simulated perfection. We practice defiant hope, cultivate real connection, and live as mortals who do not take tomorrow for granted.
